I'm currently a researcher at [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](http://www.msra.cn/). Before joining MSRA, I obtained my Ph.D. from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in June, 2019. My doctoral thesis was awarded the excellent Ph.D. thesis of Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2018/04--2018/08, I was a visitor of Prof. [Qiang Yang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~qyang/)'s group at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My work on transfer learning has won the best paper awards in ICCSE 2018 and FTL-IJCAI 2019. In 2021, I published the textbook [迁移学习导论](http://jd92.wang/tlbook), a hands-on introduction to transfer learning. In 2022, I was selected into the list of [2022 AI 2000 Most Influential Scholars](https://www.aminer.cn/ai2000?domain_ids=5dc122672ebaa6faa962c2a4) by AMiner in recognition of my contributions in the field of multimedia between 2012-2021 (ranked 49/2000).

Research interest: transfer learning, out-of-distribution / domain generalization, semi-supervised learning, federated learning, and related applications such as activity recognition and computer vision. *Never stop looking for highly self-motivated students for internship or collaboration.*

<!-- ### Highlights

1. Four of my papers are highly cited and ranked top 20 globally in recent 5 years in Google scholar metrics! See [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/421192644).
2. I wrote a popular book [迁移学习导论](http://jd92.wang/tlbook) to make it easy to learn, understand, and use transfer learning.
3. I lead the most popular transfer learning and semi-supervised learning projects on Github: [Transfer learning repo](https://github/jindongwang/transferlearning) [![Transfer learning repo](/assets/img/transferlearning-repo-star.jpg)](https://github/jindongwang/transferlearning) and  [Semi-supervised learning repo](https://github/torchssl/torchssl) [![SSL repo](/assets/img/torchssl-star.jpg)](https://github/stars/torchssl/torchssl)
