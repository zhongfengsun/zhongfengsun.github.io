I'm currently a teacher at [Shandong University of Technology(SDUT)](https://www.sdut.edu.cn/). Before joining SDUT, I obtained my Ph.D. from School of Mathematical Sciences, Capital Normal University in June, 2009.  In 2021/08--2021/10, I was a visitor of Prof. [Yunbin Zhao](http://www.sribd.cn/teacher/18)'s group at Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data(SRIBD). 

Research interest: Compressed sensing

<!-- ### Highlights

1. Four of my papers are highly cited and ranked top 20 globally in recent 5 years in Google scholar metrics! See [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/421192644).
2. I wrote a popular book [迁移学习导论](http://jd92.wang/tlbook) to make it easy to learn, understand, and use transfer learning.
3. I lead the most popular transfer learning and semi-supervised learning projects on Github: [Transfer learning repo](https://github/jindongwang/transferlearning) [![Transfer learning repo](/assets/img/transferlearning-repo-star.jpg)](https://github/jindongwang/transferlearning) and  [Semi-supervised learning repo](https://github/torchssl/torchssl) [![SSL repo](/assets/img/torchssl-star.jpg)](https://github/stars/torchssl/torchssl)
